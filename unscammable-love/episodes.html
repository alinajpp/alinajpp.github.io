      <h3 id="s2e1">Episode 1: Now Put Your Hands Up</h3>
        <p>Tonguey believes she killed Murderer and is awaiting her trial in the local prison. She's scratched a calendar into the cell wall, on which she checks off December 20. There's a knock on the cell door, and Tonguey turns in horror--only for a tray to slide through the food slot with a card on the top reading: MERRY CHRISTMAS! :P.<br>Murderer is on the run from the Chicago Mafia and is wearing disguises as other emojis. Currently, he's holed up in a cheap apartment around the questionable side of Chicago. He leaves only for groceries and whatnot, paying in cash at a nearby rundown 7-11 dressed differently each time. The first expedition shown, he disguises himself as the crying face emoji and buys a bag of Cheetos and a Double Gulp. The cashier takes sympathy and gives him a 50% discount.<br>Returning to his apartment, he watches TV while taking a long sip of his Double Gulp and ripping up the bills on the cardboard box serving as his coffee table. The news show the newly elected mayor, Birdie Sanders, giving a speech concerning Chicago’s mobs. The camera zooms out of the screen, showing Jeff “Tax Reduction” Springer and the Chicago Mafia watching while twirling their guns absentmindedly. Jeff simply says: “Boys, I think we know what we have to do.”</p>

        <p>Murderer has agreed to the plan, he prepares</p>
      <h3 id="s2e5">Episode 5: Déjà Vu</h3>
        <p>"Wait has this happened before?</p>
      <h3 id="s2e6">Episode 6: Who Run the World</h3>
        <p>Girls</p>
      <h3 id="s2e7">Episode 7: End of Time</h3>
