  <h3>The Reproduction of Monkfish</h3>
  <p>The mating process of anglerfish is pretty graphic, but can be summed up as the male biting onto the female, usually at the belly, then fusing his face into her body. He loses his eyes and fins, and produces sperm whenever the female produces eggs. Their tissues and blood vessels merge to become one. The male lives out the rest of his days like this, as a lump attached to the femaleâ€™s body.</p>
