      <h3>Paradise Fashion was created in 2017 by Alina as a helpful style blog.</h3>
      <p>Inspired by her sudden turn towards clothes and the joy she found in styling, she decided that Paradise was the way to head to give to people like her. Like anyone struggling with their closet, she felt that she didn't have <i>enough</i> to be fashionable. But faced with the struggles of not being able to make it to the nearest clothes store and owning only three pairs of shoes that she was willing to wear, she had to make do. With the help of the internet and the people around her, Alina styled outfits around what she knew would look newest to her acquaintances.</p>
      <p>Despite her stubborn refusal to wear an article of clothing other than shoes or jackets twice in one month, ("I don't have much of a choice with those," she admits) Alina settled among the many dresses and prints of her closet. It took some trial and error, but she discovered what went best with each other - and she's still finding it. Her exploration in style is not yet finished. Whenever she thinks back to her past years and reflects on her fashion choices, she regrets it. "I can't believe I thought it was a good idea to wear neon pink jackets and neon pink leggings at the same time," she says. However, she believes those wild experiments in outfits helped her discover her current style.</p>
