        <li>Keep things varied - avoid wearing the same articles of clothing more than once a week.</li>
        <li>Jackets are the exception, and shoes if you only own like three pairs.</li>
        <li>If clothes need or want to be repeated, put them in a different outfit. Chances are, if your outfit is so sleek and stunning, people won't notice that you just wore that shirt just three days ago.</li>
        <li>No matter the season, sunglasses are the handiest thing to have on hand. With the right shape for your face, they're the best go-to accessory when your outfit seems drab.</li>

        <li>(Sunglasses cont'd) Not only do they make you look extremely cool, but they are really good protection. And honestly, tucking them in your hair makes you look good no matter what.</li>
        <li>Embrace the fall with warm tones and denim. You'll blend right in with the dead leaves.</li>
        <li>Ankle booties + rolled down knee-high socks + tights + cute skirt or dress = your best friend.</li>
        <li>Don't know what to wear? Throw on a denim jacket with a "plain" outfit to give it some sense of direction.</li>
        <li>Check the weather forecast. You don't want to step out into 85 degree heat wearing leggings and a coat.</li>
        <li>Shoot for an aesthetic. Maybe carry around a camera to seem artsy or have out a Starbucks cup to look as basic as possible. One of the best parts of fashion is dressing up like someone else while staying true to yourself, though it's been proven that the more you like your outfit, the more confident you are.</li>

      <h2 id="article">6 Winter Fashion Tips for Looking Good When It’s Too Cold to Deal</h2>
      <h3>By LEAH BOURNE, Stylecaster</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Become a layering pro.</b> There is a reason layering is always on-trend in the winter: It’s a massively practical way to dress when it’s really cold. So don’t be afraid to pile on the layers. A turtleneck, under a sweater, under a jacket, under a coat, for instance, will definitely keep you warm. So will a dress or skirt over a pair of pants (much warmer than a pair of tights).</li>
        <li><b>Let your boots steal the show.</b> Great winter style really boils down to a great pair of boots. Got a great pair of over-the-knee boots? Show them off pairing them with a short dress. Have killer ankle boots you want to make sure the world gets to see? Pair them with cuffed jeans or a dress. And if it’s snowing and you are forced to wear less than fashionable snow boots? Use them as a jumping off point to put together a great new inventive outfit, rather than just throwing them on with just anything.</li>
        <img style="width: 100%; padding: 5px;" src="https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/main-original-585x02.jpg?w=578&h=866&zoom=2">
        <li><b>Belt your coats to give them new life.</b> By the middle of winter it’s pretty inevitable that you’re going to start to feel some fatigue when it comes to putting on your boring old winter coat day after day. Add new life to your coat simply by belting it. Cinching your waist will make it seem almost like you have a brand new coat. The best news of all: This styling trick will work with just about any coat style—we’ve even seen some serious fashionistas belt puffer coats!</li>
        <li><b>Wear a show-stopping hat.</b> Your first instinct in the winter is to splurge on a pair of boots or a coat, but we’re here to advise you to also hunt high and low for the winter hat of your dreams. You’re going to be in that thing for a solid two months from here on out (not to mention it’ll be the first thing people will notice about you), so it should be something you love.</li>
        <li><b>Experiment with scarves.</b> Scarves can be worn in many more ways than simply wrapped around your neck, and winter is the perfect time to experiment. We love the retro look of a scarf tied around your head, belted on top of a jacket, or even tied in a knot around your shoulders.</li>

      <h2>Man Spotted Wearing Neon Green Shirt for Second Time This Week</h2>
      <p>The spottings continue; the culprit remains at large.</p>
      <p>"I took one look at him and my eyes burned for two hours afterwards," said one witness. "All I could to see were spots."</p>
      <p>This outfit violates two of the most important rules of fashion (which should never be taken seriously): 1) never [visibly] wear the same shirt twice in a week, and 2) never wear neon green.</p>
