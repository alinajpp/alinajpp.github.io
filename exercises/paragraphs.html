<title>Hope is the thing with Feathers</title>
<body style="background-color:MistyRose;">

<pre>
  Hope is the thing with feathers  
  That perches in the soul,  
  And sings the tune without the words,  
  And never stops at all,  
</pre>

<p>
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
<br>
And sore must be the storm  
<br>
That could abash the little bird 
<br>
That kept so many warm.  
</p>

<pre>
Iâ€™ve heard it in the chillest land,  
And on the strangest sea;         
Yet, never, in extremity,  
It asked a crumb of me.
</pre>
